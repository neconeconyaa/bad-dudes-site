## ACRE 101: Is It Wrong To Fumble Radios In Tanoa?!

In most missions, riflemen will be given radios that hook into the ACRE directional sound and radio module. These radios simulate real life radios within reason and are our primary means of communication in an operation when out of audible range.

The standard issue radio is a AN/PRC-343, commonly referred to as a "343". 343s are short-range personal radios for communication within the squad and fire team. You can speak over your radio at anytime by holding down the activate key (default: Caps Lock).

Additionally, radios are configurable by ACE interact. Hold down the ACE Self-Interact key to bring up the menu and inspect the radios option. Your 343 will be listed among the radios you have on your person. You can open the 343 itself at this point to bring up the menu:

Squads will regularly separate into different channels to isolate radio chatter. At the start of a mission, your squad leader may tell you to change to a radio channel. It is your responsibility to open your 343 and set your radio to your squad's channel.

## Radio Ettiquite: 

* Don't thumb the radio activate key like it's a clitoris 
* If you micspam, you will be shot 
* Speak clearly, efficiently, and be terse: get the point across 
* Ask the listening party to confirm your last if the message is important
* Actually do that often. It's a good practice
